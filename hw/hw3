1. Alice and Bob are each creating a one-time pad so they can exchange secret numbers.
First, Alice flips a coin three times, then Bob does the same. As Bob is flipping his
coin for the third time, Eve overhears him exclaim:
    “Wow, we got the same three flips! What are the odds?!”
Later, Eve intercepts a message containing the number 5 from Alice and one
containing the number 3 from Bob. What numbers could Alice and Bob have sent?

Sol:
    Bob and Alice got the same 3 flips of the coin. I'm assuming this is their key.
    They must have used the same key (which is the same length as message), otherwise
    it is impossible to determine their messages.

    Alice intercepts
    Ca = 101 = 5 -> alice
    Cb = 011 = 3 -> bob

    It follows that
    Ca (XOR) Cb = 101 (XOR) 011 = 110 = Ma (XOR) Mb

    So,
    (Ma, Mb) = (000, 110) or (111, 001) or (110,000) or (001, 111)
             = (0,6) or (8,1) or (6,0) or (1,8)

    Alice and Bob could have sent eachother either 1 and 8, or 6 and 0.

2. Suppose you are given a pseudo-random number generator function R that takes
a 128-bit seed s, an integer n, and an integer m, and outputs the nth (inclusive)
through mth (exclusive) pseudo-random bits. Define the key generation algorithm,
the encryption algorithm, and the decryption algorithm you would need to use R
for secure symmetric-key encryption.

Sol:
    Suppose IV is some intialization vector.

    Symmetric-Key-Generation Algorithm:
    K = KG(N, M) = R(IV, N - IV, M + IV)

    Encryption Algorithm:
    E(M, K) = K (XOR) M = C

    Decryption Algorithm:
    D(C, K) = K (XOR) C = M

3. Your security consulting firm is hired by a secretive government agency that
wants you to steal a mysterious device from a famous number theorist. The job
almost goes awry when his girlfriend shows up just as you are leaving his office,
but you manage to retrieve the device.
    When you get it back to your lab, you decide to play around with it. After a
while, you discover that it does something you didn’t think was possible: it can
factor any prime number in just a few seconds.
    You decide
    (1) that you weren’t paid nearly enough for this job, and
    (2) that there are too many secrets in the world.
    Design a decryption function D(C, KE ) that efficiently decrypts any
RSA-encrypted ciphertext C based on the public key KE that was used to encrypt
it. You can represent the function implemented by the device as
    F(n) = p,q,... where n is any number and p,q,... are its prime factors.

Sol:
    D' is the standard RSA decryption function

    def D(C, KE):
        extract n, e from KE
        F(n) = p, q
        let k = (p - 1)(q - 1)
        let KD = e^-1 mod k
        return D'(C, KD)
