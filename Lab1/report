                            Defense of Design

    The bed of the program's logic is in in crackSingle. A character array named
keySpace is traversed as to find all combinations of possible passwords. Each
for loop walks through 62 characters, so the nested set of for loop walks
through the entire search space (62^4). Each combination is then passed to crypt
with salt, which is the first to characters of the user name. The encrypted
output is then captured in order to compare it to the encrypted password that
was originally passed to the function.
    In crackMultiple, the file is first parsed using parseFile in order to
separate the file into user names and their associated encrypted passwords. The
arrays of user names and encrypted passwords are simultaneously traversed and
passed to crackSingle.
    In crackSpeedy, the parameters are passed to crackMultiple.
    CrackStealthy is yet to be implemented.
