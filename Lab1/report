                            Defense of Design

    The bed of the program's logic is in in crackSingleReentrant, where all
combinations between lower and upper of an array keySet are traversed and formed
in a four character string. That string is then passed to crypt with salt and
compared to the cryptographic hash cryptPasswd. If it's a match, it's saved to
crackedPassword. This function is then run in 24 separate threads, splitting
the search space.
    Every function uses crackSingleReentrant. For crackStealthy, in order
to bypass the CPU usage requirement, I forked a child process which piped the
cracked password back to the parent.
